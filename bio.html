        Scott has been working and playing with software since 1976 when he got
        his hands on his father's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-67/97">HP-67</a> programmable
        calculator. While studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
        University of Colorado, Boulder, he did early internet monitoring and
        operations work at <a href="https://www.westnet.net">Westnet</a> around
        1994.
      </p>

        Scott began his software career as a Software Design Engineer at
        Microsoft in 1995, starting just before the release of Windows NT 3.51.
        He worked on the RPC and Shell (UI) systems of Windows NT. Since then,
        he has built a voice communication service for the early web,
        contributed to early versions of Cisco's VPN client, built cable modem
        firmware from scratch, shipped a billion Android devices at Qualcomm,
        built a machine learning team at Amazon, and helped Google Drive
        continue to scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently on a break from the industry, Scott is tinkering with small,
        fun projects like
        <a href="https://scotthal.github.io/mazes-in-typescript"
          >generating mazes in a variety of programming languages.</a
        >
        He maintains his passion for building software and software teams.
