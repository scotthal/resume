        Scott has been working and playing with software since 1976 when he got
        his hands on his father's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-67/97">HP-67</a> programmable
        calculator. He did early internet operations work at
        <a href="https://www.westnet.net">Westnet</a> around 1994.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scott began his software career at Microsoft in 1995, where he worked on
        the RPC and Shell systems of Windows NT. Since then, he has built a
        voice communication service for the early web, contributed to early
        versions of Cisco's VPN client, built cable modem firmware from scratch,
        shipped a billion Android devices at Qualcomm, built a machine learning
        team at Amazon, and helped Google Drive continue to scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently on a break from the industry, Scott is tinkering with small,
        fun projects like
        <a href="https://scotthal.github.io/mazes-in-typescript"
          >generating mazes in a variety of programming languages.</a
        >
        He maintains his passion for building software and software teams.
